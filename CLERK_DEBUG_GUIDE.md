# Debugging Clerk Registration Security Validation Error

## What I've implemented to help debug this issue:

### 1. Enhanced CSP (Content Security Policy)
Updated the CSP in middleware.ts to include all necessary Clerk domains:
- `https://*.clerk.dev` 
- `https://*.clerk.accounts.dev`
- Added Stripe domains for payments
- Added `frame-src` for embedded components

### 2. Enhanced Webhook Logging
Added detailed logging to `/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`:
- Request ID tracking
- Webhook secret configuration status
- Payload length logging
- Detailed verification error logging

### 3. Debug Endpoint
Created `/api/debug/webhook-test/route.ts` to test webhook accessibility

### 4. Rate Limiting Exclusions
Excluded Clerk API routes from rate limiting to prevent interference

## Steps to Debug the Registration Issue:

### Step 1: Check Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your Vercel environment:
```env
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### Step 2: Verify Webhook Configuration in Clerk Dashboard
1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Select your application
3. Go to "Webhooks" section
4. Ensure webhook URL is: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
5. Check that these events are enabled:
   - `user.created`
   - `user.updated` 
   - `user.deleted`

### Step 3: Test Webhook Connectivity
Visit: `https://your-domain.com/api/debug/webhook-test`
This should return JSON showing the webhook endpoint is accessible.

### Step 4: Monitor Logs During Registration
1. Open Vercel dashboard logs
2. Try to register a new user
3. Look for console messages starting with `[webhook:...]`
4. Check if webhook is being called and if verification succeeds

### Step 5: Check Browser Console
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Try to register
3. Look for CSP violations or network errors
4. Check if any Clerk scripts are being blocked

## Common Issues and Solutions:

### Issue 1: Webhook Not Called
- Check if webhook URL is correct in Clerk dashboard
- Ensure webhook endpoint is publicly accessible
- Verify webhook secret is correctly set

### Issue 2: CSP Violations
- Check browser console for CSP violations
- The updated CSP should resolve most Clerk-related issues

### Issue 3: Rate Limiting
- Updated middleware excludes Clerk routes from rate limiting
- Check logs for "rateLimit hit" messages

### Issue 4: CORS Issues
- For development, CORS is allowed for all origins
- In production, check if requests are being blocked

## Next Steps Based on Log Output:

1. **If webhook logs show successful verification**: The issue is likely in the frontend/CSP
2. **If webhook verification fails**: Check webhook secret configuration
3. **If no webhook logs appear**: Check webhook URL configuration in Clerk
4. **If CSP violations in browser**: May need additional CSP adjustments

## Test Registration After Deployment
After these changes are deployed:
1. Try registering a new user
2. Monitor both Vercel logs and browser console
3. The enhanced logging will help identify the exact failure point
